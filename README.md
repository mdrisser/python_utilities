# Python Utilities
I find myself consistenly needing to write the same basic functions over and over again, converting between units, etc., so I created this python module to address that issue. This is an ongoing endevour, I'll be adding new files and functions as I deem necessary, so check back to see if there is anything new.

# Convert
This file contains several functions to perform unit conversion, metric to imperial, temperature, length, etc.

# Helpers
Various helper functions that I really don't know how to categorize.

# Terminal
Contains various functions and "constants" to make life easier when working in the terminal (things like printing the degree symbol)
